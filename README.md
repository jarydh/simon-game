# simon-game
Plays a game of Simon with the user. The game shows the user a random sequence of colors and has them repeat it back. The program uses existing libraries to generate the sequence and display it on a simulated hardware device. When reading user inputs, invalid inputs are rejected. The program will react to the user “cancelling” the game within one second.  

To run: requires DAQ simulator (available to UBC Applied Science students only).
